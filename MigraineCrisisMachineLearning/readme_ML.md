# Migraine Crisis Machine Learning
Machine Learning algorithms and Data Processing

Here there are the scripts developed in Python in my Final Master's Degree Project. With them, it can be created a SAX[1] algorithm to process all the data.
There's also some scripts created to calculate different ML parameters and algorithms. There's too many differentes scripts, so if you have any doubt, please ask me.

Furthermore, there are some scripts used in a project in which a group of cameras try to identify someone and follows him through a corridor and some rooms.
