# CameraSystem

Ordenar.py, Tamano.py, Distancia.py and Nuevo_tamano.py are scripts in which there are created functions that are used in real_time_object_detection2.py.

The MobileNetSSD files are the Caffe Models of a CNN which is able to detect objets. In the main Python script, I change the way it works to fits to the funcitonality I want.

Any question is welcome.
