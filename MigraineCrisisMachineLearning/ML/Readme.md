Machine Learning algorithms and Data Processing

Here there are the scripts developed in Python in my Final Master's Degree Project. With them, it can be created a SAX[1] algorithm to process all the data.
There's also some scripts created to calculate different ML parameters and algorithms. Many of this scripts only generates the data and then it is processed in MatLab o RStudio. There's too many differentes scripts, so if you have any doubt, please ask me.

Questions are welcomed.
