# SEMA
Advanced Embedded Systems Projects

Here there are a couple of scripts developed in SEMA subject. All scripts are developed with FSM (Finite State Machine) methodology (fsm.c and fsm.h)

- Alarm_Code_LED: is the merge of 3 FSM. It is a system in which there is a LED that is switched on and off by a button; and a system which turns on a buzzer if detects presence, and must be turned off by entering a secret code pressing a certain number of times another button.

- Code_YDS_PowerSaving: same functionality but aplying YDS algorithm for power savings. It changes the CLK used and its frequency, and even turns it off in order to save power.


I'll be glad to answer any question about the scripting or even about FSM,YDS or any other issue.
