Embedded Systems Projects

Here there are the Embedded Systems Projects carried out at University at the subjects of Embedded Systems and Advanced Embedded Systems (SEMA). There are some scripts from my TFM in Python as well, about data processing.

Inside every folder, there's another Readme.

I'll be glad to answer any question about programming, FSM (Finite State Machine), Real-Time OS, Machine Learning or any other issue.
